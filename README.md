# 🃏 Teen Patti - C++ Card Game

A graphical version of the popular Pakistani card game **Teen Patti**, built in **C++** using the **Raylib** library for frontend. Play against 3 bot opponents in a simple turn-based system with power card mechanics and pile logic.

## 📦 Features

- Human vs 3 Bot gameplay.

- Power cards (2, 5, 10) with special effects:

  - **2** – Play again.
  - **5** – Reverse order; next card must be less than 5.
  - **10** – Burns the pile.

- Hand, blind, and seen-blind card logic.
- Graphical card display using Raylib.
- Bot decision-making with a delay to simulate realism.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Each player is dealt:
   - 3 hand cards
   - 3 blind cards
   - 3 seen-blind cards
2. On your turn, click a card to play it if valid.
3. If no valid card is available, pick up the pile.
4. When hand cards run out, seen-blind cards are picked up.
5. When those run out, blind cards are revealed one by one.
6. The first player to run out of all cards wins.
